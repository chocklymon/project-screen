# Image Screen Share

This is designed to be a simple solution to display an image in a browser window and
controlling what image is displayed using another browser window.

### Why?
I wanted to be able to display some images on a second monitor while controlling what is
displayed using the main monitor.

## Install and Run
- Run `npm install` to install the needed dependencies.
- Run `npm start` to get the server started.
- In a browser go to `localhost:3000` (3000 is the default port).
